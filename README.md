# QueueUp Player for Android

This the Android Player for [Queueup](https://github.com/extrakt/queueup-spotify.git). Read that for much more information.

This is a working demo without full Spotify player functionality. The only configuration necessary is to add the `spotify_client_id` and `facebook_app_id` string resources in `strings.xml`. These can be obtained by creating applications on the respective sites.
